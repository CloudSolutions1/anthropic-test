Institutions with operations outside Canada will calculate their institution-specific CCyB requirement based on the geographic location of their private sector credit exposures. This requirement is a weighted average of the requirements applied in jurisdictions where they have credit exposures. The CCyB requirement is reported in datapoint address (DPA) 1190 on schedule 10.010. The calculation takes into account the risk-weighted assets (RWA) for private sector credit exposures, which are based on the location of ultimate risk. The add-on rate for the CCyB is found on the BIS website and should be reported to four decimal places. The weighted buffer add-on percentage for each country is the product of the geographic weight and the CCyB add-on rate. This percentage is reported in DPA 1190 on schedule 10.010. \n\nFor Category III SMSBs, the CCyB requirement is reported in DPA 16017 on schedule 10.011. Private sector credit exposures are reported as the asset value instead of RWA, and the geographic weight for jurisdictions is calculated based on the institution's asset value.

      "summary": "The Counter-Cyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) for Category III SMSBs is outlined in section 1.7.2 of the guideline. Institutions with operations outside Canada will calculate their institution-specific CCyB requirement by looking at the geographic location of their private sector credit exposures and weighting it based on the requirements in the jurisdictions where they have credit exposures. This buffer is reported in datapoint address (DPA) 1190 on schedule 10.010. The CCyB requirement is calculated as a weighted average of the requirements in different jurisdictions. The geographic weight for each jurisdiction is determined by dividing the institution's credit risk charge for private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction by the institution's total credit risk charge for private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions. The add-on rate for the CCyB is found on the BIS website and should be reported to four decimal places. The weighted buffer add-on for each country is the product of the geographic weight and the CCyB add-on rate. The total weighted buffer add-on percentage for all countries/jurisdictions should be reported in DPA 1190 of schedule 10.010. \n\nFor Category III SMSBs, private sector credit exposures are reported as the asset value instead of risk-weighted assets (RWA) in schedule 10.041. The geographic weight for jurisdictions is calculated based on the institution's asset value that relates to private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction divided by the institution's total asset value that relates to private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions. The total weighted buffer add-on percentage for all countries/jurisdictions should be reported in DPA 16017 of schedule 10.011.\n\nOff-balance sheet exposures excluding derivative and securitization exposures are reported in schedule 10.050. This schedule splits off-balance sheet instruments between the type of credit risk approach used (standardized, FIRB, and AIRB) and reports the notional amount of the exposure. Derivative and securitization exposures are reported separately in schedules 60.030 and 70.030, respectively.\n\nMemo items in the BCAR include information on derivatives, off-balance sheet exposures, and securities financing transactions (SFTs). These memo items are not included in the calculation of the simplified risk-based capital ratios but institutions are required to inform OSFI if they exceed the thresholds for either derivative or off-balance sheet exposures.\n\nSchedule 10.020 summarizes risk-weighted assets (RWA) and exposure at default (EAD) by exposure class. The RWA and EAD data are generally carried forward from supporting schedules in the return.

It includes information on basket credit default swaps, total capital required for interest rate position specific risk on tranched products, total minimum capital charge for market risk, valuation adjustments for less liquid positions, and memo items related to the backtesting of consolidated value at risk models.\n\nThe Category III BCAR is a subset of schedules from the full BCAR return and is completed by Category III SMSBs. The reporting frequency for the Category III BCAR is the same as for the full BCAR. The Category III BCAR includes schedules such as simplified risk-based capital ratio calculations, countercyclical buffer requirements, capital and total loss absorbing capacity elements, and minimum capital required for operational risk.\n\nInstitutions filing the Category III BCAR should notify OSFI at least 30 days in advance of their first filing.

The deduction from capital for gains on sale must continue to be reported in Part A of the appropriate securitization schedule (schedule 60.010 or 60.020). Schedules 60.010 and 60.020 distinguish between senior and non-senior exposures as well as between securitization exposures excluding resecuritization, and resecuritization exposures. Resecuritization exposures must be reported on Schedule 60.010, as these exposures must use the standardized approach (SEC-SA). The definition of a senior exposure is provided in section 6.2.1.12 of the guideline. The on and off-balance sheet exposures reported on schedules 60.010 and 60.020 combine synthetic and traditional securitizations and should reconcile in total to the \"Total Exposure (credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet)\" figures reported net of specific allowances on Schedule 60.030 for standardized and IRB, respectively. Exposures may be netted against Stage 3 allowances held against the securitization itself, and originators may also net Stage 3 allowances held against assets underlying assets against associated 1250% risk-weighted securitization exposures. Schedule 60.020 is divided into four main sections: Select originator securitization exposures, SEC-IRBA Exposures, Securitization exposures subject to the internal assessment approach (IAA), and Exposures subject to caps based on KIRB or an IRB EL-adjusted risk weight. The section also includes memo items for reduction in risk-weighted assets for amounts retained that exceed KIRB and total RWA of exposures subject to a 1250% risk weight."

      "schedule": "60.030 - Summary of Banking Book Securitization Exposures",
      "summary": "Schedule 60.030 is a summary of banking book securitization exposures. It includes exposures with a senior/subordinated structure and non-proportional credit protection. If the assets underlying the securitization are reported on the institution's balance sheet, they must meet the operational requirements for recognizing credit risk transfer in order to be excluded from general credit risk treatment and follow the securitization treatment. Exposures that do not meet the definition of securitization exposures or the operational requirements should be reported as if they had not been securitized and follow the general banking book credit risk treatment.\n\nThe schedule collects banking book exposure classes, which are categorized by exposure type. The exposure classes include sovereigns and central banks, public service entities, multilateral development banks, banks (excluding covered bonds), covered bonds, corporate, specialized lending, other credit risk-weighted assets, regulatory retail, non-regulatory retail, and residential real estate. Each exposure class has specific risk weight factors applicable to it.\n\nThe schedule also includes information on guarantees, credit derivatives, and collateral under the simple and comprehensive approaches for credit risk mitigation. It collects the impact of these mitigants on net exposures and the risk weight adjustments. Additionally, it captures the weighted average maturity of the exposures.\n\nThe schedule further includes sections for select originator securitization exposures, SEC-IRBA exposures, and securitization exposures subject to the internal assessment approach (IAA). It provides details on the treatment of gains on sale, credit-enhancing interest-only strips, and the calculation of credit risk using the SEC-IRBA and IAA.\n\nThere are also sections for unrated exposures measured under the standardized approach (SEC-SA) and other unrated exposures. These sections outline the treatment of unrated exposures and the application of risk weights.\n\nFinally, the schedule includes a section for exposures subject to caps based on KIRB or an IRB EL-adjusted risk weight. These caps limit the risk weight or dollar amount of certain securitization exposures.\n\nOverall, Schedule 60.030 provides a comprehensive summary of banking book securitization exposures and their treatment under various approaches and risk weights."

      "summary": "Section A of schedule 70.030 reports the notional amounts of all derivatives, regardless of whether they attract a capital charge or are in the banking or trading book. The notional amounts are reported by product type and by contract type, with precious metals and other commodity contracts reported under \"Commodity Contracts\". The notional amounts are further broken down by maturity band.\n\nAll credit derivatives are reported in section A as well. Credit derivatives through which the reporting institution has acquired protection for hedging banking book exposures or counterparty credit risk on trading book OTC derivatives are treated as credit risk mitigants. Credit derivatives through which the reporting institution has provided protection are also reported separately.\n\nSection B of schedule 70.030 collects information on the credit equivalent amount of derivatives, which is the basis for the default risk capital requirements. The credit equivalent amount can be calculated using the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) or the internal model method (IMM). The total outstanding credit equivalent amounts reported on schedule 70.030 should equal the credit equivalent amounts reported for OTC derivatives across the exposure class schedules.\n\nSection B also includes information on counterparty credit risk exposure for default risk capital requirements. The general methodology for calculating the credit equivalent amount is provided, and certain derivatives may be excluded from the calculation. The section also explains the treatment of multiple margin agreements and multiple netting sets.\n\nSection C of schedule 70.030 reports the total central CCP credit-risk weighted assets, which is the sum of the risk-weighted assets for exposures to qualifying CCPs and total default fund contributions.\n\nSchedule 80.010 reports the credit valuation adjustments (CVA) risk-weighted assets for bilateral OTC derivatives. Two methods for calculating the capital charge for CVA risk are outlined: the Advanced method and the Standardized method.\n\nOverall, schedule 70.030 provides detailed information on derivative contracts, including notional amounts, credit equivalent amounts, and risk-weighted assets for default risk and CVA risk."

      "schedule": "70.040 - Central Counterparty (CCP) credit RWAs",
      "summary": "The context provided describes various schedules and methodologies related to Central Counterparty (CCP) credit Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs). \n\nSchedule 10.020 is used to reconcile and validate RWAs and Exposure at Default (EAD) with the BCAR IRB schedules. The reported RWAs and EADs on the IRB schedules must be carried forward to the appropriate column on Schedule 10.020 based on the calculation approach used.\n\nCredit or market RWAs calculated on the deducted portion of non-significant investments in financials are reported on Schedule 40.290 with a 0% risk weight. If an institution's reporting system calculates RWA on the total non-significant investments in financials, the excess RWA can be identified and backed out using a separate line.\n\nSchedule 10.030 collects details on the capital floor calculation for institutions using internal model-based approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, or market risk. Institutions using the standardized approach are not subject to the capital floor and are not required to report this schedule.\n\nThe RWA floor adjustment is based on the difference between the 'floor requirement' and the 'before-floor requirement'. The floor requirement is calculated by applying the floor adjustment factor to standardized credit, market, and operational risk RWAs, less 12.5 x allowances eligible to be included in capital. The before-floor requirement is calculated as credit, market, and operational risk RWAs, as reported on Schedule 10.020, less 12.5 x allowances eligible to be included in capital.\n\nThe floor adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%, but OSFI may require institutions to apply a higher or lower factor based on individual reviews. The factor will be phased-in over 3 years, starting at 65% in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.\n\nStandardized credit risk RWAs should be calculated using approaches that do not require IRB model approval. For securitization exposures, SEC-ERBA and SEC-SA approaches are included in the calculation of standardized credit risk RWAs.\n\nSchedule 10.040 collects information on the Countercyclical Buffer (CCyB) calculation. The methodology for calculating CCyB is described in the General Methodology section.\n\nSchedule 50.010 to 50.250 collects information on Credit Risk Weighted Assets under the IRB Approach for insured exposures subject to DLGD floor. The exposures are reported based on the PD, LGD, and other factors.\n\nSchedule 70.040 collects information on Central Counterparty (CCP) exposures. Section A reports exposures to qualifying CCPs, Section B reports default fund contributions to non-qualifying CCPs, and Section C summarizes the total CCP credit-risk weighted assets.\n\nSchedule 80.010 calculates the capital charge for Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA) risk on bilateral OTC derivatives. The Advanced method is used for portfolios using the Internal Models Method (IMM), while the Standardized method is used for other portfolios.\n\nSchedule 60.030 summarizes Banking Book Securitization Exposures. The exposures are reported based on the type of credit risk approach used, and senior and non-senior exposures are distinguished.\n\nThe context also provides information on the calculation methodologies and adjustments used in the various schedules."

It mentions that accumulated net after-tax revaluation losses reflected in retained earnings should be considered in the valuation of own-use PP&E accounted for using the cost model. It also states that certain financial instruments in the banking book, such as loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge, should be reported based on amortized cost. The context further specifies that all dollar amount data should be reported in thousands of Canadian dollars and calculations yielding percentages should be reported to two decimal places. It also provides information on the scope of reporting entity, credit risk schedule completion, credit risk treatment of securitization exposures, adjustments to gross balances, and other items of note. Additionally, it discusses the treatment of collateral, risk weights, and maturity in the reporting of securitization exposures.

      "summary": "Schedule 90.010 is the Market Risk schedule that institutions must complete if they meet the qualifying criteria for computing market risk capital requirements. The schedule provides details on the general methodology for calculating capital requirements for interest rate and equity risks on instruments in the trading book, as well as general risk charges for foreign exchange and commodities risk. There are two methodologies available for calculating capital required under the market risk framework: the standardized approach and the internal models approach. The standardized approach uses prescribed factors and breakdowns of portfolios, while the internal models approach uses institution-specific models for Value at Risk (VaR), stressed VaR, incremental risk charge, and a comprehensive risk measure. The interest rate position specific risk capital requirement for tranched products and basket credit default swaps can only be calculated using the standardized approach. The schedule also includes requirements for qualifying internal models and instructions for reporting required market risk capital. Additionally, the schedule provides information on the BCAR Short Form for Category III institutions and the basis of measurement and reporting units."
